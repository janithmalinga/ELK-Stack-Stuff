---Setup Cerebro---

sudo unzip /labs/cerebro-0.7.1.zip -d /opt

sudo mv /opt/cerebro-0.7.1/ /opt/cerebro/

Cerebro is now extracted into the /opt folder and ready to set up as a system service. To do this, you first should create a new Linux username to run the Cerebro service and assign ownership the installation folder to that account. Enter the following commands to make a service account for Cerebro and set the filesystem permissions so the cerebro account owns the folder it is installed in:

sudo useradd cerebro
sudo chown -R cerebro: /opt/cerebro/

sudo cp /labs/1.2/files/cerebro.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cerebro.service


---start cerebro---
sudo service cerebro start
sudo service cerebro status

---open cerebro---

By default, Cerebro listens on port 9000, to confirm Cerebro has started, open Firefox and navigate to 
http://localhost:9000

If you see the Cerebro homepage, it has been successfully started. Enter http://localhost:9200 into the hosts box on the Cerebro login page and press Connect. Clicking the Connect button will connect you to the Elasticsearch node running on port 9200


---Create an index template---

Navigate to the more menu in Cerebro and select the "index templates" option.

In the next screen, you should see the "Create new template" section.

Enter "curator" as the name of the template. Modify the section below or cut and paste the text from the wiki so that it matches below: 

{
  "template": "logstash-curator-*",
  "settings": {
      "index.routing.allocation.require.box_type": "hot",
      "index.number_of_shards": "2",
      "index.number_of_replicas": "1"
  },
  "mappings": {},
  "aliases": {}
}

Once the information is entered, press the Create button to make theindex template.

---Create sample indices---

Now, create some empty sample indices now to observe how Elasticsearch allocates shards across your 2 nodes. To create a new index, select the "more" drop-down in Cerebro and select "create index."

Create the first index with a name of "test-0", you do not need to enter a number for shards or replicas since you have just defined it inside the "no_replicas" template.

Press the "Create" button

You should see a blue message saying "1 indices created". Next, repeat the process but name the index "test-1". The number of shards for this index was defined in the "one_replicas" template, so again, the number of shards boxes can stay blank.

Press the "Create" button

You should see another message saying the index was successfully created.

Finally, make a third index named "logstash-curator-1" without specifying the number of shards or replicas, since this is defined in the "curator" template.

Press the "Create" button

This index is unique and will allocate shards differently than the "test-#" indices. This is because the naming convention matches the "logstash-curator-*" index pattern you designated in the previous step in the "curator" template. You will now check to verify the indices were created as expected.

--- Check shard allocation---

Now, clean up your test indices by deleting them from the cluster using the Cerebro interface. Perform the actions below for indices test-0 and test-1, but DO NOT delete index logstash-curator-1.

To delete an index, click on the small triangle in the corner next to its name and click on the "delete index" option:
